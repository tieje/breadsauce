I'd like to make this site a single page while exploring new technologies.
This site will serve the purpose of being the wedding website and part of my portfolio.

yarn is faster than npm as a package manager
vite is MUCH faster as a bundler than anything else I've ever used before.
I'm really impressed by them both, but especially by Vite.

+ use yarn and vite to build a react-ts template
    yarn create vite breadsauce --template react-ts
+ yarn install
+ upgrade yarn
    curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
+ test dev server
    npm run dev
+ install tailwindCSS
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
+ install react-spring
    yarn add react-spring 
+ install @react-spring/parallax
    yarn add @react-spring/parallax

What I actually need a sticky div until a certain point and some animation and that's it.
What I'm going to do is run a few lines at different speeds and then have a sticky punchline off-screen that stays for a while.

+ play around with parallax
+ figure out how to use parallax in React Spring for your purposes

+ I would like the frontpage to play a brief animation of a letter dropping from above and opening - transforming into the wedding info.
    The letter drops from below, but I can't believe I got it down.

Parallax picture component is a colossal failure. Somehow it worked before, it looks like I'll need to build everything myself by hand. I'm not sure why it worked before and not this time...
I'm going to transition away from this and I'll define everything myself.

+ updated packages
    yarn upgrade
+ currently hosting on RPI
+ add background picture to fontpage
+ get money-shot screenshot
+ updated porfolio
+ individuals alone
+ us together
+ static information frontpage
x picture and caption page
    picture, no caption
+ final page that just says forever
~ high res picture of villa
    close enough

Plan

1. Create the static components first while studying react-spring
2. Add animation later?

TODO

Create Static Pages

- poetry page
- picture and banter page

Later

- Host this site on AWS. See what you can do for free.
