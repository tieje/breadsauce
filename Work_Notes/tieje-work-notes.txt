I'd like to make this site a single page while exploring new technologies.
This site will serve the purpose of being the wedding website and part of my portfolio.

yarn is faster than npm as a package manager
vite is MUCH faster as a bundler than anything else I've ever used before.
I'm really impressed by them both, but especially by Vite.

+ use yarn and vite to build a react-ts template
    yarn create vite breadsauce --template react-ts
+ yarn install
+ upgrade yarn
    curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
+ test dev server
    npm run dev
+ install tailwindCSS
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
+ install react-spring
    yarn add react-spring 
+ install @react-spring/parallax
    yarn add @react-spring/parallax

What I actually need a sticky div until a certain point and some animation and that's it.
What I'm going to do is run a few lines at different speeds and then have a sticky punchline off-screen that stays for a while.

+ play around with parallax
+ figure out how to use parallax in React Spring for your purposes

+ I would like the frontpage to play a brief animation of a letter dropping from above and opening - transforming into the wedding info.
    The letter drops from below, but I can't believe I got it down.

Parallax picture component is a colossal failure. Somehow it worked before, it looks like I'll need to build everything myself by hand. I'm not sure why it worked before and not this time...
I'm going to transition away from this and I'll define everything myself.
Unfortunately, I still can't use animxyz and I think it's because I really need to just use one animation library at a time.

+ updated packages
    yarn upgrade
+ currently hosting on RPI
+ add background picture to fontpage
+ get money-shot screenshot
+ updated porfolio
+ individuals alone
+ us together
+ static information frontpage
x picture and caption page
    picture, no caption
+ final page that just says forever
~ high res picture of villa
    close enough
+ install animxyz
    yarn add @animxyz/react

Parallax might be too overwhelming for other animations being done at the same time on the same page.
However, I should be able to do it outside of the page.
The being next to parallax doesn't work very well. I'll need to be a sibling of parallax's parent to work otherwise.
In this way, I can create sections and animations and it should probably still work, but without parallax.

It's possible that the hooks don't work well with TailwindCSS because of the re-rendering.
Animation hooks work as intended when imported from another component. Probably a state management re-render thing.
Unfortunately, clicking does not work as intended, meaning there is something rendered on top of it.
When take outside of the parallax component, everything works as intended.
Being a sibling of parallax does not work as intended.
TailwindCSS does not interfere with the css inline styling.
Parallax does interfere with clicking on pictures.
I think what I'll do is have two different experiences for mobile and web.
I think I would like to have a kitchen table 

x change the closed letter to an offset and speed rather than sticky
x add an SVG flower on the card
+ update pictures such that they appear as regular pictures on mobile md size and below
    This must be done by render two entirely different applications: one for mobile, and one for desktop.
+ finalize the design of the frontpage
x make it so that the letter spins and comes from and stops slight

x add white-rose repeating background
    It just doesn't look that good.

Try and do this for you letter:

Plan

1. Create the static components first while studying react-spring
2. Add animation later?

TODO

- get poems from Mayenne

Create Static Pages

+ swap and remove any unneeded pictures
+ remove the gif and maybe some pictures to see if performance improves for mobile when not connected to wi-fi
+ switch import statements so that you load more important pictures and modules first
- create a loading sceen... Unfortunately, I don't exactly run a query. I somehow need to run it on IMG.
- put the additional info after the opened letter
- add donation button with venmo, paypal, and maybe cashapp
- additional info includes attire, wedding registry info (cash is fine)
- poetry page
- picture and banter page

Later

- Host this site on AWS. See what you can do for free.
