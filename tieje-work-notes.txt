I'd like to make this site a single page while exploring new technologies.
This site will serve the purpose of being the wedding website and part of my portfolio.

yarn is faster than npm as a package manager
vite is MUCH faster as a bundler than anything else I've ever used before.
I'm really impressed by them both, but especially by Vite.

+ use yarn and vite to build a react-ts template
    yarn create vite breadsauce --template react-ts
+ yarn install
+ upgrade yarn
    curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
+ test dev server
    npm run dev
+ install tailwindCSS
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
+ install react-spring
    yarn add react-spring 
+ install @react-spring/parallax
    yarn add @react-spring/parallax

What I actually need a sticky div until a certain point and some animation and that's it.
What I'm going to do is run a few lines at different speeds and then have a sticky punchline off-screen that stays for a while.

+ play around with parallax
+ figure out how to use parallax in React Spring for your purposes

Plan

1. Create the static components first while studying react-spring
2. Add animation later?
